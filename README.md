# BITS Blockchain dev recruitment task : Round 1

## Introduction

Your comprehensive examinations are coming up (and I do hope you are preparing well for them!) and your professor is preparing your question papers from a question bank. <br><br>
But there is a twist. Each student that attends the examination must receive a different set of questions.

## Problem statement
Implement a smart contract integrated with a web app, that serves a different set of questions for each user that logs into the platform.

## Resources
Please usse the resources compiled in the official [BITS Blockchain Notion page](https://bitsblockchain.notion.site/Resources-for-blockchain-enthusiasts-d69a20cf5402406cb709dfabe4150c87).

## Judging criteria
<ol>
  <li> Creativity in minimizing the ability to cheat during the exam (assume online mode of examination)
  <li> Code organization within the project
  <li> Associated documentation that explains the details of the project and how to run it
</ol>

## Do's
<ol>
  <li> Please make bash files to automate any terminal processes. The evaluators too have their examinations coming up, and any code that doesn't run by executing the bash script will be discarded.
</ol>

## Dont's
<ol>
  <li> If any part of the code is found similar in participants, then both the participants will be subject to disqualification.
</ol>

## Motivation for project quality
The best project that comes out of the recruitment task will be considered for use in the future recruitment rounds of BITS Blockchain, subject to review.
